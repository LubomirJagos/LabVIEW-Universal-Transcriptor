# LabVIEW-Universal-Transcriptor
When I saw LabVIEW for first time I was hooked. I already knew few programming languages, but always think how great it wil be to know another "better" language. But then I randomly got to knew LabVIEW and graphical programming + I studied radiocommunications so signal processing was on daily programme :D In the moment I felt that it's somehow diagrams are translated into machine code. I was thinking about that for last years, but haven't time to really implement this idea.

So I started and this repositary is my storage for this. I little dig inside LabVIEW Scripting and LabVIEW again surprised me, as simple as it looks, that simple it is :D Diagrams are really diagrams inside LabVIEW and they are easily accessible from it, so everybody can traverse any diagram and transform it to anything what you want.

My target for now is C code for Arduino :)
